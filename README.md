# Rabin-PKC-Encryption-Decryption-LateX-
In this report, a particular cryptosystem called Rabin Cryptosystem is presented in a client-server model and analysed with the help of Chinese Reminder Theorem. 

The coding modules are in Java programming language.

Rabin cryptosystem is an asymmetric cryptographic technique,Asymmetric key cryptography uses two set of keys,public key and a private key.The public key shall be announced to everyone and private key is know only between the sender and receiver. The public key encrypts the given plain text and the private key decrypt's the cipher text received.
